# Saving/Arbitrage Opportunities across Amazon Europe
*by Andre, Ricardo, Uli @ Ironhack Lisbon Oct 30th 2020*

## Project Description
The idea is to copy & paste any Amazon product page into the program. The link is first checked if it is a correct Amazon product page and then the prices for this product on Amazon Spain, Germany, Italy and France are scrapped and potential shipping costs (from the Portuguese perspective) are added. Total prices are then compared and a recommendation is given on where to buy the product. For some products the differences are significant so that comparing is worth.
